![CI state](https://github.com/daeuniverse/flake.nix/actions/workflows/lint.yaml/badge.svg)

## build with nix

```nix
nix build .#dae
```

## Experimental build

If you would like to get a taste of new features and do not want to wait for new releases, you may use the `experimental` (exp branch) flake. The `experimental` flake is always _**ahead**_ with the upstream `dae` and `daed` (sync with upstream `prs` to test new features or fix bugs) projects. Most of the time, newly proposed changes will be included in PRs, will be fully tested, and will be exported as cross-platform executable binaries in builds (GitHub Action Workflow Build).

> [!WARNING]
> Noted that newly introduced features are sometimes buggy, do it at your own risk. However, we still highly encourage you to check out our latest builds as it may help us further analyze features stability and resolve potential bugs accordingly.

Adopt Experimental flake

```nix
# flake.nix
{
  inputs.daeuniverse.url = "github:daeuniverse/flake.nix/exp";
  # ...

  outputs = {nixpkgs, ...} @inputs: {
    nixosConfigurations.HOSTNAME = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      modules = [
        inputs.daeuniverse.nixosModules.dae
        inputs.daeuniverse.nixosModules.daed
      ];
    };
  }
}
```

## Use with flake

Enable dae or daed module

```nix
# configuration.nix

# to see full options, check dae{,d}/module.nix

# with dae
  services.dae = {
      enable = true;
      package = pkgs.dae;
      disableTxChecksumIpGeneric = false;
      configFile = "/etc/dae/config.dae";
      assets = with pkgs; [ v2ray-geoip v2ray-domain-list-community ];
      # alternatively, specify assets dir
      # assetsPath = "/etc/dae";
      openFirewall = {
        enable = true;
        port = 12345;
      };
  };
```

```nix
# with daed
  services.daed = {
      enable = true;
      package = pkgs.daed;
      configdir = "/etc/daed";
      listen = "0.0.0.0:2023";
      openfirewall = {
        enable = true;
        port = 12345;
      };
  };
```

## Directly use the packages

```nix
environment.systemPackages =
  with inputs.daeuniverse.packages.x86_64-linux;
    [ dae daed ];
```
